With this program you can create dots and lines on a canvas, fit a line on two dots and create the intercept of two lines.
This was my first homework for the Graphics course at BME.

## Modes:
- Press 'p' for dot creator mode.
- Press 'l' for line creator mode.
- Press 'm' for moving lines.
- Press 'i' for creating the intercept of two lines.
